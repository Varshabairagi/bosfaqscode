A Raag describes the musical scale, structure and how to create a melody. Each Raag reflects a different spiritual mood or tone and is sung at different times of the day. Within each Raag, the Shabads are arranged in chronological order by Guru, followed by the Bhagats (Muslim and Hindu Saints). The first part includes basic Nitnem Banis (Jap Ji Sahib, Rehraas Sahib and Sohila Sahib), Raag section and the other Banis at the end that are not written in the Raags."

      "text": "Mughal leader Aurangzeb decided to make India a Muslim country. He began charging non-Muslims a tax and forcefully converting Hindu temples into mosques. So, Pandit Kirpa Ram Dutt and 15 other Kashmiri Hindu Pandits came to Guru Tegh Bahadur for help. Gobind Rai, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji’s son, told Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji that They were the best individual to help the Hindu pandits find justice. Guru Ji told the Governor of Kashmir that if he can get Guru Ji to convert, the pandits will also convert. On July 12, 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was arrested. Guru Ji was brought to Sirhind. In Sirhind, the Governor kept Guru Ji in prison for four months as leading Islamic individuals tried to convince Guru Ji to convert. Guru Ji did not change Their mind, which infuriated Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb decided to bring Guru Ji to Delhi in a cage. The Qazi (Muslim priest) gave a Fatwa (religious order) that Guru Ji embrace Islam, show a miracle to prove Their divinity, or be prepared to die. Guru Ji still didn’t bow down to fear and convert. Guru Ji became Shaheed (martyr) on Maghar Sudi 5, 1732B i.e. 19th December 1675 AD at Chandni Chowk, Delhi. This place is known as Gurdwara Sri Sis Ganj Sahib now.So many people have given their life to protect their religion and community. Guru Ji gave Their life to protect people from a completely separate religion. While Guru Ji did not wear a Janeyu (sacred Hindu thread), Guru Ji achieved martyrdom so that others could have the right to wear it. This one-of-a-kind Shaheedi (martyrdom) clearly embodies the Sikhi values of equality and prioritizing justice."

•	What to do when someone slanders the Guru
•	Giving Tankha (religious punishment/consequence)

•	Amrit (Immortal Nectar) must be administered by the Panj Piaare in the presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji
•	Sikhs should keep their mind, body and wealth attuned only in Akaal Purakh (the Timeless Being)

      "text": "\"A Dastar (turban) serves as a constant reminder that God is forever present. It is an insignia of Guru Ji’s teaching that a Sikh must hold a high level of moral responsibility. A Dastar also gives Sikhs their unique identity and it is a royal crown given to Sikhs by the Gurus. A Dastar symbolizes equality and does not discriminate against anyone. 


Do the Different Colors and Styles Mean Anything?

Essentially, no. Some styles, such as the Dumalla (du=two, malla=materials) were more commonly worn by Sikh warriors. Other styles may be more predominant in certain Sikh communities, such as the triangle style for Sikhs from Kenya.


Do All Sikhs Wear a Dastar?

All Sikhs have been ordained to keep their hair; therefore, most practicing Sikhs will wear a Dastar. Sikhi has no age or gender barriers, so women and children can also wear a Dastar. Some women and younger Sikhs may also wear a variety of head coverings such as a Chunni, Rumaal or Patka. 

It is very disrespectful to touch or ask a Sikh to remove their Dastar. A Sikh will only remove the Dastar in extreme circumstances or when showering/sleeping, while still keeping their head covered. It is not headwear but an article of faith. A Sikh will treat Dastar with great respect even when removing it. \""

Bhai Ram Das Ji helped create the Santokhsar Sarovar and started a Langar (community kitchen) as well.

Creating the Lavaan - Guru Ram Das Ji created the Lavaan, which are now used in the Sikh Anand Karaj.

The Lavaan helped to formalize Sikh marriage, enabling Sikhs to step away from Hindu Vedic traditions and claim their own identity. \""

Sikhi based on dealings or Dhandey Di Sikhi is when one becomes a Sikh to deal with other Sikhs or even the Guru. They might become a Sikh to marry a Sikh boy or girl or make deals with Guru Sahib asking for something in return for doing Seva. Sikhi based on copying others or Dekha Dekhi Vali Sikhi is when someone becomes a Sikh because they want to feel like they belong. This is when the focus is more about the external than the internal and does not last very long. Sikhi based on greed or Hirsee Di Sikhi is when someone who has embraced Sikhi with the motive of greed. This person might think that if they become a Sikh then they will receive a lot of monetary wealth and only pursue Sikhi for this reason. Sikhi based on faith or Sidak Di Sikhi is when one embraces Sikhi with full faith and dedication to Guru Sahib. This Sikh never turns his/her back to Guru Sahib no matter what happens. Sikhi based on emotions of love or Bhav/Prem Di Sikhi is when one embraces Sikhi out of love for Guru Sahib. Someone practising this will love Vaheguru so much that they obtain Vaheguru. The accepted forms of Sikhi are Sidak Di Sikhi and Bhav Di Sikhi. To learn more about these types of Sikhi check out our article on the Five Types of Sikhi."

Harnakash’s son, Bhagat Prahlad Ji, was a devotee of Raam and refused to worship his father instead of God. Upon hearing this, Harnakash tried to drown Bhagat Prahlad. This did not work. He then tried to drop Bhagat Prahlad off a mountain. This also did not work. Harnakash even tried to burn Bhagat Prahlad alive, but all his efforts failed. When nothing worked, Harnakash tied Bhagat Prahlad to an iron pole and reached for his sword. Before he could lift his sword, the pole broke and God, in the form of Narsingh (Head of a lion, body of a human), came out from the pole.

      "text": "\"Yes, ego came into the children of the Gurus (Enlightener). The first Guru's sons weren't very happy because none of them became the second Guru. The first son was especially expecting it to be him, but Bhai Lehna Ji, the first Guru's disciple, became the second Guru. The second Guru's son, Bhai Dattu Ji, was so upset that the third Guru wasn't him. He actually went up and kicked the third Guru, Guru Amar Daas Ji, even though Guru Amar Daas Ji was much older than him. Out of respect for Guru Angad Dev Ji (second Guru), Guru Amar Daas Ji didn't attack this young man back. 

The fifth Guru's elder brother (Baba Prithi Chand Ji) was actually quite upset that the Guruship went to the youngest brother. He expected it to come to him because he was the eldest. However, it didn't go to him, it went to the younger one and he was quite upset. For many years, he would call himself the True Guru. He would steal all the donations from the Sangat (congregation), just for himself. He did this with hopes that his younger brother, Guru Arjan Dev Ji would have a really hard time. Guru Arjan Dev Ji did have a harder time building Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. This is because there was very little funding coming for it. Most of the money was taken by the elder brother. So ego was inside all the families of the Guru. Ego is just everywhere.

      "text": "\"At Darbar Sahib (the court of Guru Granth Sahib Ji), the Sikhs often recite “Satnaam Sri Vaheguru Sahib Ji.” It’s a very old Mantar. They’ve been chanting that for a very long time, from the very beginning. We can use the word Sri, as it simply means the highest. Sri (sometimes spelled as Siri) is the abbreviated form of the word Shromani (highest). Sri Vaheguru means the highest Wondrous Enlightener. We often recite, “Satnaam Vaheguru” as a short Mantar and “Satnaam Sri Vaheguru Sahib Ji” as a longer Mantar. It’s the same thing, so don’t get confused.

Understand what Satnaam means first. Then understand what Vaheguru means as well. There’s a lot hidden in the Vaheguru Mantar, such as there are four main letters in Vaheguru and each letter means something.  There’s a video on our channel called Why do we chant the Vaheguru Mantar? since there are many meanings of the mantar. So don’t worry about the word Sri. Some people say, “Dhan Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji'' and “Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji”. While others may just say, “Guru Angad Dev Ji.” Ultimately, Sri is a way of showing respect. Whether someone says it or not, there’s no need to have debates and arguments over it.

On various occasions, he used to go to the jungle to meditate for many years at a time. Once,  he meditated as such for so long that termites began to build a home on his body. The word Valmik means home of termites in Sanskrit, and from this point onward, he was known as this. Due to his intense meditation, he could tap into the past and future. Through this, he attained knowledge of the life of Sri Raam Chandar Ji (incarnation of Treta Jug). Rishi Valmik Ji then wrote the Ramayana in 24,000 verses with deep thoughts and hidden meanings. Through deep meditation, he could recall all the events that took place in Raam Chandar Ji’s life and wrote everything down. 

A time came when Sita Ji (Raam Chandar Ji’s wife) was banished from the kingdom and came to stay with Rishi Valmik Ji. Rishi Ji raised Sita Ji’s two children, Luv and Kush, who then became great scholars and memorized the Ramayana. Rishi Valmik Ji sent Luv and Kush to go to distant places to preach the great Ramayana to sages, poets, and the general public. Luv and Kush eventually returned and lived at the ashram with their mother and Rishi Valmik Ji. A time came when they engaged in wars with the greatest armies of that time. Luv and Kush had learned the art of war from Rishi Ji and were able to destroy even Raam Chandar Ji’s army. After seeing the brave warriors his sons had become, Raam Chandar brought Luv, Kush, and his wife back to his palace. Upon hearing the Ramayana, Raam Chandar Ji said that until this world remains, Rishi Valmik’s Katha (discourse) shall remain. This story is written within Sri Gur Bhagat Mala Steek by Giani Narain Singh Ji. To learn more about this topic, check out our article on Rishi Valmik Ji.\""

Once, a saint informed Raja Janak Ji that it is impossible to obtain liberation without a Guru. After hearing this, Raja Janak Ji called many saints and scholars to his palace. He asked for someone to provide him with spiritual knowledge in the amount of time it took him to mount on his horse. Nobody came forward to fulfill this request, as they all believed this was impossible. One person named Ashtavakar stepped forward. He had a hunchback and only had one arm. Ashtavakar asked Raja Janak Ji to give him his body, mind, or wealth before receiving any wisdom. Raja Janak Ji decided to give up his mind, thinking that he would not lose much in doing so. At that time, Ashtavakar took control of Raja Janak’s mind and said that the mind no longer wished to mount the horse. Ashtavakar even said that the mind wished to take off the royal clothes and robes that he was wearing. At this time, Raja Janak took off his clothes and received spiritual wisdom. The path of happiness is to not listen to one’s mind. Raja Janak then spent his whole life as a devotee of God. To learn more about him, check out our article Raja Janak Ji."

You just have to be a human being to be a Sikh. Be a part of the human race, that's it. A black person and a white person can definitely merge with the Creator. There are many mystics from Christianity and Islam, whom we have accepted as great beings. The best example of this is the fact that Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji contains writings of people who weren't Sikhs, such as Bhagat Kabir Ji and Bhagat Fareed Ji. So Guru Ji (Enlightener) has given them the highest status. For Sikhs, when they bow down to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, they bow down to the writings of those people as well. Why? Because those writings are concurrent with Guru's writings. Those people from other faiths have realized the Truth. The eternal true reality exists everywhere. People can access that reality and they write about it. Those writings are going to be enlightened writings. Enlightenment is not something that only Sikhs have. Everybody has it.

Go and ask them, “Would you change Mool Mantar (root mantra)?” Nobody can change Mool Mantar.

The Dasam Duaar is hidden and we can only open it and experience God if we read Bani, connect to Naam and reach out to God with love and devotion. 

One example of Guru Ji describing the Dasam Duaar is in Anand Sahib when Guru Ji says,

ਵਜਾਇਆ ਵਾਜਾ ਪਉਣ ਨਉ ਦੁਆਰੇ ਪਰਗਟੁ ਕੀਏ ਦਸਵਾ ਗੁਪਤੁ ਰਖਾਇਆ ॥

Vaheguru blew the breath of life into the physical body, and revealed the nine doors; but They kept the Tenth Door hidden.

ਗੁਰਦੁਆਰੈ ਲਾਇ ਭਾਵਨੀ ਇਕਨਾ ਦਸਵਾ ਦੁਆਰੁ ਦਿਖਾਇਆ ॥

When one comes to the Guru’s Door with loving devotion, then the Tenth Door is revealed to them.
